# Solvd-LABA
## TO-DO:
```
- Read text from the file and calculate the numbers of the unique words. 
Write the result to the file. The main requirement is: using 
StringUtils and FileUtils to implement it with minimum lines of code.
- Add 7 collection streaming in the hierarchy with terminal and non-terminal operations.
- Using reflection extract information(modifiers, return types, parameters, etc) about fields, constructors, methods. Create object and call method using the only reflection
```
## Changelog:
```
- Moved whole project to quickstart maven archetype
- Deleted all demo code for previous homework and stored it in a txt just in case
- Installed dependencies for StringUtils and FileUtils
