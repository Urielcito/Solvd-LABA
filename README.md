# Solvd-LABA
## TO-DO:
```
- Log messages to the console, file (log4J)
```
## Changelog:
```
- Installed log4j in the current project
- Added 5 custom exceptions (NoNameException, NegativeAgeException, NegativeIntException, InvalidGenderException and TooYoungException, all of them are in class 'Person').
- Handled them first with throws inside 'Person' class and with try-catch in the main() method.
- Used try-with-resources inside 'Person' class on static method 'personFromInput' utilizing the Scanner class.
