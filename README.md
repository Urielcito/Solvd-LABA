# Solvd-LABA
## TO-DO:
```
- Deploy jar file to the local repository??
- Read text from the file and calculate the numbers of the unique words. Write the result to the file. The main requirement is: using 
StringUtils and FileUtils to implement it with minimum lines of code.
1.Add 7 collection streaming in the hierarchy with terminal and non-terminal operations.
2. Using reflection extract information(modifiers, return types, parameters, etc) about fields, constructors, methods. Create object and call method using the only reflection
```
## Changelog:
```
- Built jar file located in 'target' folder.
- Different maven lifecycle commands worked succesfully (install, package, compile, validate) deploy command didn't work
```
